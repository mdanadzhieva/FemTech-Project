FemTech Website Project

FemTech is a comprehensive platform designed as part of an 8-week online course in Web Development to spotlight the significant achievements of women in the IT and technology sectors. The website aims to gather insightful news articles, detailed profiles, and engaging interviews that celebrate and promote the contributions of women in technology. 
Additionally, FemTech was inspired by the course provider Code First Girls to offer valuable resources for women seeking to advance their careers in the tech industry. These resources will include professional development tools, networking opportunities, and mentorship programs. 
Furthermore, FemTech is dedicated to fostering a supportive community where women in tech can connect, collaborate, and find encouragement to thrive in their professional journeys. Through these initiatives, FemTech aims to inspire the next generation of female tech leaders and contribute to a more inclusive and diverse technology landscape.
